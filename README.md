# ESP32_server
Very simple, but understandable version of the web application to save, use and analyze data from sensors, which are connected to ESP32. This is not an OpenSource project, it's just my first steps, but the current product version you can use on the portal https://iot.tfeya.ru (http://esp32.tfeya.ru).

I made code rewriting, using SOLID, DRY, however, it's in the next code versions. But this works! You can repeat my code and make your own IoT-server. Here is the fully workable project to make your first steps to receive values of the sensors, connected to WiFi-powered microcontroller. If you want to know, how you can begin with IoT, it's a good way to try this code.
